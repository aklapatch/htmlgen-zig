 # HTMLgen-zig
 A zig library for generating html documents.

# TODO:
- fix the compilation error for the `HTMLElement` tests. It currently does not compile due to a LLVM module error. A different implementation of the `.formattedBuf()` method is probably necessary.
- implement an `htmlDoc` object that can write all the html elements to a file.
- test everything besides the `HTMLAttribute` class (it has already been tested)
- write documentation
